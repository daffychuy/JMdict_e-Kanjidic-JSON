# What is this
This repository contains the two script that I am using for converting all the xml data to a more friendly and usable file that allows me to parse for the dictionary app project. (Link coming soon)

# Why such a script
For someone who have worked with data type that's not xml, it makes more sense to have a more friendlier datatype to be working with aka Json in my case

# How to use
Simply place JMdict_e and kanjidic2.xml in this directory and run ```python3 JMdict_Parser_xml``` and ```python3 Kanjidic_Parser```.
If your file is of different name, simply modify the FILE variable in the python script. (May add option to ask for file location)

# Python version tested
Tested on Python 3.6.9~3.8.1, but should work with any python 3 version.
